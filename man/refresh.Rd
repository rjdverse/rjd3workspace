\arguments{
\item{policy}{the refresh policy to apply (see details).}

\item{period, start, end}{to specify the span on which outliers will not be re-identified (i.e.: re-detected) when \code{policy = "Outliers"}
or \code{policy = "Outliers_StochasticComponent"}.
Span definition: \code{period}: numeric, number of observations in a year (12, 4...).
\code{start} and \code{end}: first and last date from which outliers will not be re-identfied,
defined as arrays of two elements: year and first period (for example, if \code{period = 12}, \code{c(1980, 1)} for January 1980).
If they are not specified, the outliers will be re-identified on the whole series.}

\description{
Refresh Workspace or SAProcessing
}
\details{
Available refresh policies are:

\strong{Current}: applying the current pre-adjustment reg-arima model and adding the new raw data points as Additive Outliers (defined as new intervention variables)

\strong{Fixed}: applying the current pre-adjustment reg-arima model and replacing forecasts by new raw data points.

\strong{FixedParameters}: pre-adjustment reg-arima model is partially modified: regression coefficients will be re-estimated but regression variables, Arima orders
and coefficients are unchanged.

\strong{FixedAutoRegressiveParameters}: same as FixedParameters but Arima Moving Average coefficients (MA) are also re-estimated, Auto-regressive (AR) coefficients are kept fixed.

\strong{FreeParameters}: all regression and Arima model coefficients are re-estimated, regression variables and Arima orders are kept fixed.

\strong{Outliers}: regression variables and Arima orders are kept fixed, but outliers will be re-detected on the defined span, thus all regression and Arima model coefficients are re-estimated

\strong{Outliers_StochasticComponent}: same as "Outliers" but Arima model orders (p,d,q)(P,D,Q) can also be re-identified.
