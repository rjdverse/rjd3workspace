\arguments{
\item{policy}{the refresh policy to apply (see details).}

\item{period, start, end}{to specify the span on which outliers will not be
re-identified (i.e.: re-detected) when \code{policy = "Outliers"} or
\code{policy = "Outliers_StochasticComponent"}.
Span definition: \code{period}: numeric, number of observations in a year
(12, 4...). \code{start} and \code{end}: first and last date from which
outliers will not be re-identfied, defined as arrays of two elements: year
and first period (for example, if \code{period = 12}, \code{c(1980, 1)} for January
1980). If they are not specified, the outliers will be re-identified on the
whole series.}

\description{
Refresh Workspace or SAProcessing
}
\details{
Available refresh policies are:

\strong{Current}: applying the current pre-adjustment reg-arima model and
adding the new raw data points as Additive Outliers (defined as new
intervention variables)

\strong{Fixed}: applying the current pre-adjustment reg-arima model and
replacing forecasts by new raw data points.

\strong{FixedParameters}: pre-adjustment reg-arima model is partially
modified: regression coefficients will be re-estimated but regression
variables, Arima orders and coefficients are unchanged.

\strong{FixedAutoRegressiveParameters}: same as FixedParameters but Arima
Moving Average coefficients (MA) are also re-estimated, Auto-regressive (AR)
coefficients are kept fixed.

\strong{FreeParameters}: all regression and Arima model coefficients are
re-estimated, regression variables and Arima orders are kept fixed.

\strong{Outliers}: regression variables and Arima orders are kept fixed, but
outliers will be re-detected on the defined span, thus all regression and
Arima model coefficients are re-estimated

\strong{Outliers_StochasticComponent}: same as "Outliers" but Arima model
orders (p,d,q)(P,D,Q) can also be re-identified.
